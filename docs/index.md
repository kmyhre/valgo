## Welcome to Valgo!
This is where information regarding Valgo, the iOS election calculator, lives. This is also where you can find Valgo's source code, available to you for free.

### Features
Valgo is an election calculator for elections utilising the Sainte-Laguë method, capable of calculating elections based on the number of votes and depending on the preferences of the election administrators.
* Parties closest to gaining or losing a seat with the current vote distribution are indicated as such
* As the order of awarded electoral seats are important in Sainte-Laguë style elections, every seat is numbered as it is awarded to a party.
* Using Sainte-Laguë's modified method, with a first divisor other than 1.0, as among others Norway (1.4) and Sweden (1.2) do, is supported.
* Valgo supports thousands of parties and seats to be awarded.
* Currently, Valgo is supported in English and Norwegian. Please feel free to reach out if you would like to help translate Valgo to your language!

*Screenshots are taken using the development version of v1.0-beta.5, and the test data used is the results of the parliamentary elections of Oslo in 2017.*

### Planned features
In the future, these features will be added:
* Export to PDF, including detailed charts and the exact quotients used
* Importing parties and votes from Excel, in particular on macOS
* User interface improvements for macOS and iPadOS

### Beta testing
Would you like to participate in testing the latest beta? It is available through Apple's [TestFlight](https://testflight.apple.com/join/yuMl8zTx) service, and any testing and feedback (regarding bugs, UI, features missing, unnecessary features, etc.) is greatly appreciated.

### Development
Valgo is maintained by people doing it in their free time, and without any formal training in programming. This means a lot of the code can probably be improved upon quite a bit. Feel free to open a pull request if you'd like to help out! We'll figure this out together.
