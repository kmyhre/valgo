## Welcome to Valgo!
This is where information regarding Valgo, the iOS election calculator, lives. This is also where you can find Valgo's source code, available to you for free.

### Beta testing
Would you like to participate in testing the latest beta? It is available through Apple's [TestFlight](https://testflight.apple.com/join/yuMl8zTx) service, and any testing and feedback (regarding bugs, UI, features missing, unnecessary features, etc.) is greatly appreciated.

### Development
Valgo is maintained by people doing it in their free time, and without any formal training in programming. This means a lot of the code can probably be improved upon quite a bit. Feel free to open a pull request if you'd like to help out! We'll figure this out together.

### Contact
